# dandi-nwb-meta

This project gathers the NWB metadata for assets in DANDI Archive (public dandisets only) and stores them in a cloud bucket. It also assembles tables in .md files within the repo. The scripts run in GitHub actions.

See [neurodata_types.md](./neurodata_types.md) for a list of all the neurodata types with the associated dandiset IDs.
